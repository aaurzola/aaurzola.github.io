          <li><strong>Lead vocalist and keyboardist (1985-1986):</strong> Petrucci asked his high school bandmate Kevin Moore to play the keyboard. Another friend from home, Chris Collins, was recruited as lead vocalist. Nontheless, In November 1986, after a few months of writing and performing together, Chris Collins was fired.</li>
        <li><strong>2nd vocalist (1987): </strong> After a year of trying to find a replacement, Charlie Dominici, who was far older and more experienced than anyone else in the band, successfully auditioned for the group.</li>
        <li><strong>'This is not what we are looking for' (1990): </strong> Charlie Dominici was let go because the band was starting to feel the limitations of his voice based upon the vocal style they wanted.</li>
